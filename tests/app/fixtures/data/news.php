        Booth was born in Plymouth in 1938 and educated at Rugby School and the University of Oxford. His love of books had come from his father, an army officer, who would take the child to browse secondhand bookstores. He grew up in Hay, on the border between England and Wales, after his father inherited the Brynmelyn estate, which later passed to him. ',
